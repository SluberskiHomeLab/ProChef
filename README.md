# ProChef
Open Source Recipe Management

## Introduction

ProChef is a personal project I am starting intended to improve upon all the other recipe management systems in the OSS community.\
I had some qualms with the ones that are currently available, like Mealie, Tandoor, and Recipya.  Features that I know will not be added.\
In turn, I wanted to create ProChef to implement my desired qualities.  I plan to utilize code from Mealie and Recipya to assist with this.  Shoutout to the creators of those.

## Features

These are the features that I want to develop.

1. Fast
2. Docker image
3. Database compatibility with postgre, Mysql/MariaDB, MSSql, and SQLite.
4. Multiple Users
5. User Management
6. Permission groups
7. Environments (each user gets private recipes, but public cookbooks are also available to add to.
8. Recipe copying from recipe links
9. Theme customization
10. List view, tile view, and custom view.
11. Recipe searching
12. Categories and category searching
13. Ingredient tracking and ingredient searching.
14. Ingredient curation (able to put what you have in your fridge in the system and recipes you can make are outputed)
15. MFA

This will be a monumental task, but I have some time to work on this. \

## Additional Info

I am not a developer, nor have I developed and application at all, but I'm here to learn.  They say if you put your mind to something, you can do it, so that's what I'm trying to do here. 
I am just starting this now as well and will utilize what is available to me with other open source code, and possibly getting people to join me in creating this when I run out of ideas or learning capacity.
